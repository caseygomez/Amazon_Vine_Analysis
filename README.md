# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview:
In this project, you’ll have access to approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. You’ll need to pick one of these datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, you’ll use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. Then, you’ll write a summary of the analysis for the stakeholders.

### Summary:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

-How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
-How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? 
-How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
-What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? 
-What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
